# Notetaking-Chatbot
## Main Idea
This project dealt with creating a note-taking chatbot. Has ability to "remember" the last notes, and should be able to retrieve. Used nltk framework to be able to remove certain stop words. Further used nltk to get similarity words to check when to start recording a note and when to retrieve notes. Data collection is part of it to also try and keep track of when certain words are used more than others to keep in mind for future refrences.
